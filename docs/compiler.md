## Type-aware loading boundary

`compiler/load` is the only package that directly depends on `golang.org/x/tools/go/packages`. One `load.Load` call performs one `packages.Load` operation and returns the package, syntax, type, symbol, and diagnostic records that later Spice compiler phases reuse.

The loader deliberately accepts standard Go package patterns such as `./...` rather than translating them into a filesystem walk. It also passes through caller-provided working directories, environments, build flags, overlays, and cancellation.

Compiler extensions can supply exact import paths through
`Options.AuxiliaryPackages`. These roots participate in the same single
`packages.Load` call and exact `go/types` universe as application packages, so
their exported constructors can become direct provider nodes. `Packages` and
`Symbols` retain the complete typed program; `PrimaryPackages` and
`PrimarySymbols` exclude auxiliary roots. Annotation resolution and Modulith
discovery use the primary views, preventing an imported auto-configuration package's comments
or package structure from silently becoming application metadata. Auxiliary
paths are exact and explicit—wildcards, relative patterns, discovery, and
dependency-presence activation are rejected.

Package directories come from `go/packages.Package.Dir`, with selected source files as a deterministic fallback for drivers that omit it. Each package exposes a deterministic `Files` view that pairs a physical compiled-file path with its AST. The compatibility `CompiledGoFiles` and `Syntax` slices are derived from that same view and remain index-aligned; they are never sorted independently. Cgo-transformed build-cache inputs remain visible without redefining source package ownership.

Normal application compilation keeps `Tests` disabled. Requests with `Options.Tests` set to true fail immediately with a deterministic configuration diagnostic. Test-package and generated test-binary variants remain unsupported until Spice defines separate identities for production packages, in-package test variants, external test packages, and generated test binaries. This prevents duplicate stable package and symbol IDs from entering later compiler phases.

## Program lifetime

A `Program` owns one Go type universe. Package records retain live `go/types`, AST, token-file-set, and `go/packages` references for that load only. Objects or types from independent `Program` values must never be compared by pointer identity or mixed in a later compiler phase.

Ordered record methods return copies of the package, symbol, and diagnostic slices. The underlying Go semantic objects remain read-only by convention.

## Stable symbol IDs

Stable IDs describe logical source declarations and do not use absolute paths or `packages.Package.ID` values. Spice preserves identity as the structured tuple `(version, kind, package path, receiver origin, declaration name)` and serializes it canonically as:

```text
spice:symbol:v1|<kind>|<package-field>|<receiver-field>|<name-field>
field = <decimal-UTF-8-byte-length>:<exact-bytes>
```

All three fields are always present. Package symbols use empty receiver and name fields; non-method declarations use an empty receiver; methods use the normalized defining receiver origin. Examples:

```text
spice:symbol:v1|package|19:example.com/foo.bar|0:|0:
spice:symbol:v1|type|19:example.com/foo.bar|0:|1:T
spice:symbol:v1|method|19:example.com/foo.bar|1:T|1:M
```

Length-prefixing makes the encoder injective even when package paths contain dots, slashes, colons, pipes, digits, or text resembling another encoded field. Components are copied exactly: the encoder does not path-clean, case-fold, Unicode-normalize, percent-decode, or otherwise rewrite identity data. `Package.ID` and the matching package `Symbol.ID` use the same canonical package key, while `Package.Path` remains the ordinary Go import path.

`Symbol.DisplayLabel` is a concise dot-style human label such as `example.com/app.Service.Start`. It is useful in diagnostics and diagrams but is not a key and may legitimately be shared by a declaration and a package whose path contains the same suffix. Compiler logic should use the canonical ID or the structured `Kind`, `PackagePath`, `Receiver`, and `Name` fields.

Symbols are ordered by package path, the fixed kind rank `package`, `type`, `function`, `method`, `variable`, `constant`, then receiver origin, declaration name, and physical source position. Ordering never depends on the lexical details of the serialized ID grammar.

Pointer receivers normalize to the defining named type. Generic receiver declarations normalize through the `go/types.Named` origin, so receiver spelling and instantiation syntax do not change the method ID. Function and method signatures remain separate live type data because signatures can evolve independently of logical identity.

The catalog omits package-level `init` functions and every blank-identifier declaration (`_`), including types, package functions, methods, variables, and constants. Go permits multiple declarations with those names, and later Spice phases cannot address them by logical name. Excluding them preserves the one-to-one stable-ID contract without introducing filesystem- or source-order-based suffixes.

Every symbol retains two positions from the same token file set: `PhysicalPosition` uses the unadjusted loaded Go file, while `Position` is the developer-facing `//line`-adjusted location. Source ownership accepts a declaration when either its physical loaded file or its adjusted origin belongs to a selected `GoFiles` source. This preserves ordinary source-mapped generated Go and user declarations from an `import "C"` file while excluding cgo cache helpers whose physical and adjusted provenance are both generated. Adjusted paths are display metadata only and never filesystem authority.

## Diagnostics

The library does not print, exit, or mutate module files. Package-list, parse,
and type errors are collected into deterministic diagnostics and returned
through `LoadError`. Rendered Go positions remain available in
`Diagnostic.Position`, while filename, line, and column are retained as
structured fields so line 2 sorts before line 10. An ill-typed root package
remains visible in the result for diagnostics, but it is marked unsafe for
semantic generation. While `!spice_generate` files are excluded, generation
analysis validates each annotated package-main entrypoint's exact generated
package import and `Main` call, then supplies a pure in-memory package stub at
that import path. No undefined identifier or package error is suppressed, and
the stub is never written to disk.

`compiler/diagnostic` is the shared integration contract. It assigns stable
namespaced codes, severity, physical file URI/path and half-open range,
source-mapped display locations, related information, and version-aware safe
edits. Immutable sets defensively copy nested values and sort by physical
identity before display metadata. `spice verify` consumes those sets in text
mode and exposes the deterministic `spice.diagnostics/v1` envelope with
`--format=json`; command integrations never parse rendered error strings.
`compiler/service` exposes that pipeline as one read-only, overlay-aware
analysis operation. It normalizes and bounds workspace overlays, returns
source failures through the same diagnostic set, retains the immutable
application IR, and exposes defensive annotation, exact-provider, module, and
configuration summaries plus a pure generation plan. Sequenced requests are
cancelled and rejected when a newer request for the same workspace arrives;
different service instances and workspace identities remain isolated. Its
small LRU is used only when the caller supplies a hash covering all relevant
disk and overlay content, so an unkeyed filesystem request is never reused
stale. See `docs/compiler-service.md`.

The caller context is forwarded to `go/packages` and external
`GOPACKAGESDRIVER` processes; cancelling an already-running load terminates the
driver and returns `context.Canceled`.

## Dependency and offline policy

Spice requires Go 1.26.6 and pins `golang.org/x/tools v0.48.0`. The dependency is BSD-3-Clause licensed and remains isolated behind `compiler/load` so upgrades stay controlled.

The repository commits the standard output of `go mod vendor`. The local quality gate proves offline product execution with:

```text
make offline
```

Development tools are pinned separately in `tools/go.mod`; they do not enter the product module or runtime dependency graph. The loader never enables network access itself. The Go command continues to honor the caller's `GOPROXY`, `GOPRIVATE`, `GOSUMDB`, and `GOVCS` policies.

## Typed annotation resolution

`compiler/resolve` consumes one existing `load.Program`; it never walks the filesystem, reparses files, or creates another Go type universe. Only documentation comments on packages and declarations contribute annotations, and only files selected by the active Go build are examined.

File-scoped `@import` comments are collected across the complete selected
file before declaration resolution. Named bindings, aliases, and namespaces
resolve to exported descriptor functions loaded as auxiliary roots in the same
typed program. Descriptor functions are statically decoded from one returned
`sdk.Definition` composite literal and are never executed. The service performs
a bounded lexical import preflight solely to add those exact descriptor package
paths to the one semantic load. Analysis disables module downloads and selects
read-only or vendor mode. Every invocation must have a matching import in its
own file; resolution never consults a built-in registry or infers semantics
from the annotation spelling. See
[`annotation-sdk.md`](annotation-sdk.md).

`compiler/annotationhost` is the only native annotation process boundary. It
requires an exact tool declaration in the target module, resolves standard Go
module/replacement provenance offline, launches only the fully qualified
package through `go tool`, negotiates the public framed protocol, validates
declared handler source symbols, and reuses one serialized process per
workspace/tool. Cancellation terminates the full Windows Job Object or Unix
process group; failed calls are never replayed.

After ordinary target and argument validation, every occurrence is analyzed by
its imported descriptor's declared handler. The host strictly decodes the
public typed contribution union before attaching immutable defensive copies to
the resolved occurrence. Application, provider, configuration, module,
lifecycle, web, security, data, scheduling, event, cache, and bootstrap
compilers select contribution kinds and payloads rather than descriptor names.
The official `spice-annotation-core` executable follows this same external
protocol; it is not imported by compiler packages.

Each occurrence carries its canonical symbol ID, package path, target, physical file/offset, and developer-facing `//line`-adjusted position. Physical identity controls deterministic ordering; adjusted paths are display metadata only.

Grouped declaration metadata fails closed when it could describe multiple specs or names, and blank identifiers cannot be annotation targets. Place metadata on one individual spec or split a multi-name declaration.

The `spice annotations` and `spice verify` commands accept ordinary Go package
patterns and perform one load-resolve-validate pipeline. `spice verify` uses
the same persistent-tool compiler service as generate, build, run, dev, and
LSP, in validation-only mode so committed generated packages remain visible
and no application target is required. `compiler/scan.Tree` remains for
compatibility tests but is no longer the authoritative CLI source.

## Typed provider catalog

`compiler/provider` consumes the same `load.Program` and `resolve.Result` already produced for one CLI command. It never reloads packages, reparses files, walks function bodies, reflects on runtime values, or executes provider functions.

After ordinary annotation target and argument validation, each valid `@Bean`
method on a constructible `@Configuration` contributes one deterministic
provider record. Its receiver is an exact dependency and its parameters remain
ordinary provider dependencies. Package-level beans remain a migration form.
Provider metadata and explicit interface contributions target method beans as
well as package functions, so selection, ordering, scope, and exposure remain
attached to the declaration that produces the value.
Constructible `@Component`, `@Configuration`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, and
`@Repository` types select an explicit constructor, same-file `New<Type>`, or
generated `new(T)`; the `java-structured` profile rejects the generic package
`New` fallback. Validated `@ConfigurationProperties` structs contribute
explicit generated-binder provider records before graph construction. Accepted
constructor and bean signatures are `func(dependencies...) T`,
`func(dependencies...) (T, error)`,
`func(dependencies...) (T, lifecycle.Cleanup)`, and
`func(dependencies...) (T, lifecycle.Cleanup, error)`.
`lifecycle.Cleanup` is the canonical named `func(context.Context) error` type.
Recognition uses the result's live `go/types` named identity from the owning
program: aliases to the canonical type are accepted, while unnamed or distinct
defined callback types are rejected. No second package load or application,
constructor, configuration, or provider execution occurs.

The first result remains the sole output. Provider records retain `ReturnsCleanup` and `ReturnsError` flags but no runtime callback value. Inputs preserve parameter order and positions, and cleanup metadata creates no dependency edge or injectable implicit value. Records retain live `go/types.Type` values only for the owning program, plus import-path-qualified stable type strings for diagnostics and later serialization.

`@Implements` is the sole concrete-to-interface opt-in. Each positional named
Go interface expression is resolved against the physical annotation file,
including instantiated generic interfaces. A namespace `@import` may bind any
package from the loaded module graph for these expressions, so no otherwise
unused ordinary Go import is required. The compiler rejects anonymous,
pointer-to-interface, inaccessible, unresolved, non-interface, and
constraint-only expressions; checks the concrete factory result's exact
pointer/value method set; and emits a conventional blank-identifier
`var _ Interface = ConcreteExpression` assertion in the manifest-owned source
shard. Pointer outputs use typed nil, struct values use a composite literal,
and other valid concrete values use a zero-value expression. An `@Bean`
returning an interface is already an exact interface provider and rejects
redundant `@Implements`.

The compiler service builds one defensive, deterministic catalog of named
runtime interfaces from that same loaded `go/packages` type universe. It walks
selected application packages and their typed imports, retains exact package
and type identities, type parameters, complete method sets, export
visibility, and source locations, and excludes constraint-only interfaces.
The catalog is available even while an incomplete `@Implements` invocation is
being authored. LSP completion consumes the descriptor argument's
`ValueDomainGoInterface` metadata, never an annotation-name test, and emits the
exact namespace `@import` when needed. Generated assertions are renderer-owned,
never editor-authored. IDE indexes are not a DI input.

Catalog output is sorted by stable provider symbol ID. Multiple selectable
beans may expose the same exact output or explicit interface; their stable
names, aliases, qualifiers, primary/fallback state, order, and scope remain in
the immutable provider record for graph selection. Non-selectable synthetic
configuration and event providers still fail on exact-output conflicts.
Explicit starter and auto-configuration factories are selectable beans and may
contribute ordered collections when their identities are distinct. Distinct
named types remain distinct even when their underlying
representations match. The catalog does not invoke providers or cleanup,
perform reflection, install a runtime container, or scan assignability
implicitly.

`spice verify` runs this catalog stage only after loading, typed annotation resolution, target validation, and argument validation have succeeded. Library code remains quiet; the CLI owns rendering and exit status.


## Deterministic provider dependency graph

`compiler/graph` consumes one already validated `provider.Catalog` from the
owning typed compiler run. Every bootstrap provider is currently active.
Candidate collection uses a live output type identical under
`go/types.Identical` or a validated explicit interface binding. Requested
qualifiers filter candidates; non-fallbacks win; a unique candidate, sole
primary, or exact parameter-name bean-name/alias match resolves the value in
that order. Readable type IDs remain diagnostics and serialization data, not
semantic lookup authority. Spice does not implicitly project concrete values
to interfaces, equate distinct named types, or convert pointers and values.

Exact `[]T` and `map[string]T` inputs collect all candidates ordered by
`@Order`, bean name, then source; map keys must be unique. Exact generic
`bean.Optional[T]`, `bean.Lazy[T]`, and `bean.Provider[T]` inputs preserve
typed absence, once-only resolution, or explicit acquisition/cleanup
ownership. Direct dependencies on prototype/request/session beans fail with a
source-positioned scope diagnostic and require `bean.Provider[T]`.

Graph construction returns stable provider nodes, parameter edges, and a dependency-first order with stable provider IDs breaking ties. Missing inputs accumulate as source-positioned diagnostics. Tarjan strongly connected component analysis reports every self-cycle and multi-provider cycle with a deterministic closed path. Any missing input or cycle suppresses construction order. The library is quiet and never executes provider bodies.

`spice verify` runs graph validation after provider-catalog validation.
Provider cleanup, interface bindings, selection metadata, dependency kinds,
and scope ownership are preserved on graph nodes. Generated direct calls
construct application singletons, typed prototype factories, and typed scoped
providers; no generated container performs reflection or string lookup.

## Typed lifecycle-hook catalog

`compiler/lifecycle` consumes the same `load.Program`, resolved annotations, and validated provider catalog. Argument-free `@OnStart` and `@OnStop` annotations must target ordinary non-generic, non-variadic methods with the exact signature `func(receiver)(context.Context) error`. Canonical `context.Context`, predeclared `error`, receiver types, and provider outputs are compared in the existing live `go/types` universe; aliases are accepted, while assignability, convertibility, structural equality, method-set promotion, and pointer/value call convenience are not ownership rules.

Each participating provider contributes one deterministic component with an optional start hook and optional stop hook. A stop hook requires a start hook, and duplicate roles fail with source-positioned diagnostics. Components are sorted by stable provider symbol ID, diagnostics by physical source identity, and accessors return defensive copies. Provider cleanup metadata remains separate, and hooks do not become providers, outputs, dependencies, graph nodes, or edges.

`spice verify` runs lifecycle validation after provider-graph validation. The compiler stage is quiet and never executes methods, providers, or cleanup callbacks. It records metadata only. The public `lifecycle.Coordinator` implements caller-context state transitions, dependency-order start, reverse successful-start stop, reverse construction cleanup, startup rollback, deterministic joined errors, idempotent stop, and run/wait/shutdown composition. Generated code supplies direct hook method values. Reusable application APIs retain caller-owned signals, shutdown contexts, logging, and command policy; only the explicitly invoked generated command helper applies Spice's process conventions.

## Typed scheduled-method catalog

`compiler/schedule` consumes that same typed program and exact provider
catalog. `@schedule.FixedDelay` methods use the lifecycle-compatible
`func(receiver)(context.Context) error` signature. The compiler validates exact
receiver ownership, the canonical Go 1.26 context identity, exported
cross-package accessibility, required positive delay, optional non-negative
initial delay, and explicit failure-continuation policy. It sorts jobs by stable
method identity and returns defensive immutable metadata.

Generation creates one public `schedule.Scheduler` after providers are
constructed. Its job definitions carry module-or-package ownership and direct
provider method values. The scheduler is the last generated lifecycle hook to
start and the first to stop. `ApplicationOptions` exposes schedule context,
waiter, and observer seams for embedding and deterministic tests. Scheduler
construction errors pass through coordinator abort, so existing provider
cleanup still rolls back in reverse order.

## Typed asynchronous-method catalog

`compiler/async` consumes the same typed program and exact provider catalog.
Argument-free `@async.Execute` declarations target exported methods with the
non-variadic form
`func(receiver)(context.Context, arguments...) error`. The compiler validates
the canonical context and predeclared error identities, exact provider
ownership, generated-package accessibility for every argument type, and
collision-free typed `Application.Submit<Receiver><Method>` names.

Tasks are sorted by stable method identity and copied into immutable
application IR. The compiler never invokes annotated methods. This stage
feeds deterministic rendering of typed
`Application.Submit<Receiver><Method>` APIs. Generation creates one bounded
executor after providers, registers shutdown ahead of provider teardown, and
emits direct provider method calls inside accepted tasks. The generated
`spice.async.max-concurrency` property is positive, defaults to 16, and is
ownership-hashed with the task signatures. There is no runtime method lookup,
proxy, hidden queue, or global executor.

## Immutable application model

`compiler/application` is the authoritative generation input assembled from
the same loaded program and resolved annotations. It runs module,
configuration, provider, graph, controller, lifecycle, scheduling, and
asynchronous-method stages once, retains dependency-first provider order and
cleanup flags, reorders lifecycle components by that construction order,
retains deterministic scheduled jobs and typed asynchronous tasks, and
validates application targets.

The preferred `@Application` marker is the parameterless, result-free,
non-generic ordinary `func main()` in package `main`. Its selected local Go
package scope supplies compile-time discovery: package-documentation modules,
providers, controllers, configuration, jobs, events, and other supported
features are resolved in the same typed program without dummy imports in
`main.go`. The application body is never invoked. Explicit package patterns and
target identities bound multi-application monorepos.

The pre-1.0 legacy marker remains a package-level non-generic, non-variadic,
result-free function whose parameter types are roots exactly identical to bean
or generated configuration outputs. Zero markers remain valid for library
verification; multiple markers become stable application targets.

The model returns defensive metadata copies and stops at the first invalid
compiler stage. Generation must reject any model with diagnostics and must not
reload packages, rebuild the graph, or inspect declaration bodies.

Qualified bootstrap annotations are resolved by the same typed annotation
pipeline. `@management.Enable` accepts one required endpoint list, including
the explicitly opt-in redacted `configprops` report and generated `modules`
canvas, and
`@observability.Logging` accepts no arguments. The bootstrap compiler validates
their exact application-marker target, duplicate/conflicting declarations,
known endpoints, and graph requirements, then stores normalized immutable
feature metadata on each application target. List order cannot affect the
model or generated bytes. The renderer consumes only this metadata; it never
re-reads raw comments.

The feature compiler is an explicit typed definition seam for qualified
annotations. Annotation packages and their authorized tools contribute feature
metadata through the public annotation SDK. Library default beans use a
separate Go-native contract: an explicitly blank-imported
`.../autoconfigure` package exposes one statically decoded
`func SpiceAutoConfiguration() starter.AutoConfiguration`.

`provider.BuildEntrypoints` validates each typed factory reference from the
same program used for application analysis. It applies the ordinary provider
signature contract without invoking the function and retains import-path and
resolved module provenance.
`application.BuildOptions.ProviderCatalogs` merges these validated nodes into
the exact-type graph. The renderer then emits the same direct dependency-first
call, immediate cleanup registration, rollback, and error handling used for an
`@Bean`; provenance participates in the ownership hash.

Lexical preload finds canonical blank imports so those packages can join the
single typed program as auxiliary roots. Typed primary-source inspection then
selects only imports in the requested package set; imports found in unrelated
workspace packages cannot activate behavior. A sole auto factory for an exact
output backs off when that output is application-owned. When multiple defaults
intentionally contribute the same collection type, a matching application
bean name or alias replaces only that default and distinct application beans
extend the collection. A dependency closure then selects constructible
defaults. Missing functions, executable descriptor bodies, foreign or dynamic
factory expressions, unsupported signatures, duplicate ownership, graph
failures, and generation all fail closed before filesystem application.

Route authorization uses the same resolved annotation stream. A qualified
`@security.Authorize` must belong to exactly one valid `@Get` or `@Post`
method. Its Boolean, role, and scope requirements are normalized into immutable
controller IR; empty, malformed, or repeated policies fail before generation.
Policy ownership is the assigned application module, or the exact declaring
package identity when the route is unassigned.

## Deterministic generation plan

`compiler/generate` consumes the loaded program and immutable application model
without another load or graph pass. `DefaultTarget` maps the preferred
package-main marker to an importable `internal/spicegen/<target>` package,
optional OpenAPI under `artifacts/`, and one mirrored source unit per
contributing handwritten file under `sources/`. Source units own
application-marker metadata, direct provider construction, typed
configuration binding, and compile-time interface assertions.

Target-wide output is decomposed by executable concern:
`spice_contracts_gen.go`, `spice_configuration_gen.go`,
`spice_providers_gen.go`, `spice_assembly_gen.go`, optional
`spice_features_gen.go`, `spice_http_gen.go`, readable stable
`spice_http_route_<symbol>_<id>_gen.go` units, `spice_lifecycle_gen.go`, and
`spice_command_gen.go`. The assembly file only sequences bounded phases; it is
not a renamed monolith. Route logic is isolated by stable symbol identity so
unrelated route edits do not rename files. No generated Go is written beside
handwritten source. The module root remains an in-memory execution detail and
never appears in generated bytes.

The renderer emits the standard generated-code marker, sorted explicit import
aliases, a target-wide configuration schema, source-owned configuration
binders and provider adapters, generated typed/raw `net/http` adapters, direct
authorization policy/guard construction, dependency-first adapter calls,
existing graph-edge arguments, immediate cleanup registration, wrapped stable
errors, and direct lifecycle method values.
Scheduled targets additionally emit one directly wired scheduler whose
normalized definitions participate in the canonical ownership hash.
Targets with controllers also emit `artifacts/openapi.json` below their
selected output package; it is deterministic, manifest-owned, and protected by the same safe
apply/check/diff protocol as generated Go.
Configured targets add `ApplicationOptions`, `ConfigurationSchema`, and
`NewApplicationWithOptions`; sources and profiles remain caller-owned.
Generated `NewApplication`, `State`, `Start`, `Stop`, and `Run` methods delegate
only generic state and rollback mechanics to the small public lifecycle
coordinator. `Run` accepts the caller's run context and shutdown-context
factory, so the reusable application never registers signals or creates hidden
deadline/background contexts. `Components` exposes a typed snapshot of
constructed singleton beans for tests and embedding without reflection or
string lookup. Generated code imports no compiler package and uses no
reflection, package scan, service locator, or global registry.

Every package-main target exports `Main(arguments) int` from its generated
target package, which handwritten `main.go` imports explicitly. It also exposes
the injectable `RunCommand(CommandOptions) int` seam. The baseline command resolves the
generated schema from a conventional `SPICE_` OS-environment source, emits
structured construction/start/failure logs, supports `-check`, owns process
signals only in `Main`, and creates a fresh bounded shutdown context after
termination. `spice.shutdown-timeout` is typed configuration with a `10s`
default and `SPICE_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` override. Exit codes are stable: zero for
success, one for construction/run/shutdown failure, and two for invalid usage.
Errors flow through safe configuration errors and never include raw values.

Resolved companions add direct generated composition. Logging installs ordered
`log/slog` lifecycle and HTTP observers. Management constructs lifecycle
checks, optional bounded route metrics, and exactly the normalized exposed
routes, then registers its handler directly on the generator-owned
`*http.ServeMux`. Construction failures pass through coordinator abort so
registered cleanup runs in reverse order. Explicit route authorization creates
one immutable policy and guard per protected operation. Caller middleware owns
authentication and executes outside the guard; route observation remains
outermost so denied requests are measured.

Each plan includes canonical schema-5 JSON ownership metadata with target,
entrypoint package, concern-specific file roles (including one
`target-http-route` record per route), primary and related
declaration origins, exact source-to-generated ranges,
generator/formatter compatibility, a canonical model-input SHA-256, and exact
generated-file SHA-256 values. Repeated rendering is byte-identical and contains
no timestamps, absolute paths, raw environment, random values, or host data.
Generated dependency fields, source adapter imports, and route helpers are
named from their bean, package, controller, and method identities. Collision
digests supplement those names rather than replacing them.

Providers stay in importable application-module packages rather than the
process shell, and generated calls still require exported providers and hooks.
The generated-package boundary prevents fixed generated API names from
colliding with handwritten declarations. Guarded filesystem application,
check/diff mode, safe stale removal, and collision handling consume this plan
in the next layer.

## Guarded filesystem application and commands

`internal/genfs` validates every plan through Go's rooted filesystem boundary.
It rejects traversal, portable Windows device names, case collisions, output
symlinks, foreign manifest targets/schemas, unowned path collisions, manual
edits, and unexpected unowned Spice generated markers before writing.
Schema-4 monolithic target output and schema-3 adjacent source shards are
accepted only as migration input and are removed only when their recorded hash
still matches; modified legacy output fails closed.

`spice generate` exclusively locks one target, rechecks ownership, writes
same-directory temporary files, syncs and parses generated Go, verifies exact
hashes, replaces recoverably, removes only unchanged manifest-owned stale files,
and replaces the manifest last. Byte-identical source and manifest files are
not rewritten, preserving mtimes and Go build cache inputs. This is a guarded
multi-file protocol, not a claim of global filesystem atomicity.

When an application intentionally changes its Go module path, one explicit
write pass may use `spice generate --relocate-module-from <previous-module>`.
Spice accepts only a manifest whose target is otherwise identical and whose
package and entrypoint paths are exact descendants of that previous module.
Every owned file must still match its recorded SHA-256 before generation can
replace it. The option rejects the current module path, malformed paths,
manual edits, foreign targets, and use with `--check` or `--diff`; later runs
use ordinary generation with the newly written ownership manifest.

`spice generate --check` and `--diff` are read-only. Check mode reports every
deterministically sorted difference and returns nonzero; diff mode additionally
prints bounded unified-style expected/current content. `spice build` performs
the guarded generation operation and then runs `go build -trimpath ./...` in the
selected module. `spice run` applies the same guarded plan, requires the
preferred package-main layout, builds only its exact import path with
`go build -trimpath -o <unique-temporary-artifact>`, and executes it without a
shell. Application arguments follow `--`. Standard streams and nonnegative
exit codes are preserved; Windows and Unix process-group adapters relay
termination for generated graceful shutdown before escalating after a bounded
deadline. Failed generation or compilation never executes an older artifact.

Generated files include `//go:build !spice_generate`. Spice reserves and adds
the `spice_generate` tag only to generation analysis, merging existing explicit
and `GOFLAGS` tags. The exact generated-entrypoint overlay described above lets
a missing or stale generated target package be recovered without accepting
unrelated ill-typed code. Verification and annotation listing load the ordinary
committed program. Targeted regeneration can therefore exclude stale output,
while ordinary Go commands omit the tag and compile committed output.

The independently versioned
[`spice-framework/commerce`](https://github.com/spice-framework/commerce)
application is the executable reference for this contract. It declares four
modules, typed configuration, generated
controllers, explicit providers, lifecycle hooks, fixed-delay and bounded
asynchronous work, and qualified management and logging bootstrap annotations.
Its annotated `main.go` imports the generated commerce target explicitly.
Compile-time analysis of `./...` from the independent Commerce module discovers
its module roots and emits the direct-call application, mirrored source units,
and OpenAPI document below the Commerce-owned `internal/spicegen/commerce`; its
generated command owns
conventional environment loading, process signals, management composition,
metrics, and the shutdown deadline. The handwritten process boundary is only
`os.Exit(spiceapp.Main(args))`.
Its repository-owned verification runs generation freshness, generated
construction, live typed
HTTP, failure mapping, cache/event interaction, typed asynchronous submission
and drain, redacted configuration reporting, runtime module metadata, metrics,
and graceful-drain checks.

## Module discovery

`compiler/modulith` consumes the same typed program and resolved annotation
result as the application compiler. Package-documentation `@Module` markers
create full-import-path module identities. Each selected package is assigned to
the longest matching root in its Go module; nested roots therefore take
deterministic ownership, while packages outside every root are retained as
sorted unassigned metadata.

The root package is the default API. Repeatable package-level
`@NamedInterface` markers expose explicitly named descendant packages.
`allowedDependencies` entries identify an exact root API or
`module::interface`; discovery rejects malformed, duplicate, self, unknown
module, and unknown-interface references. Model accessors return defensive
copies.

Spice projects the selected program's real Go imports into distinct
cross-module package edges. Imports of a root API or named interface must match
an exact `allowedDependencies` entry. Any other descendant import is rejected
as internal at the import position. The projected module graph is decomposed
into strongly connected components; every multi-module component produces a
stable member set and representative closed cycle path. This metadata and its
diagnostics are part of the immutable application IR, so `spice verify`
enforces the same boundaries before generation.

`spice modules` loads `./...` by default and is read-only. `--format=json`
emits schema `spice.modules/v1` with a canvas for every module: owned packages,
the root default API, named interfaces, declared dependencies, observed
dependencies, exact package edges, cycle metadata, and unassigned packages.
`--format=mermaid` and `--format=plantuml` render the same sorted graph with
stable synthetic node IDs and aggregated API labels. Invalid module
architecture blocks output.

`--focus=<full-module-import-path>` produces a module test graph containing the
selected module plus only transitively observed dependencies. It excludes
dependents, unrelated modules, unassigned packages, and declared-but-unused
dependencies. JSON includes the focus identity and dependency-first composition
order; Mermaid and PlantUML highlight the selected module.

`spice test --module=<full-module-import-path>` validates the same model before
starting a subprocess. It passes the dependency-first owned-package list
directly to `go test -trimpath`, with optional race, count, run-expression, and
timeout controls. No unassigned, dependent, or unrelated package can enter the
test invocation, and the command performs no generation. Generated application
contexts and specialized web/data harnesses are separate future slices.

Generation maps each provider package back to its discovered owning module.
Generated cleanup registration and lifecycle hooks carry that full import-path
identity, and module ownership participates in the canonical manifest input
hash. `NewApplication` accepts optional lifecycle observers before provider
construction; generated applications also expose registration while still in
the constructed state. The coordinator emits synchronous begin/end events for
start, stop, and cleanup with stable component ID, module ID, operation, phase,
and callback outcome. Core selects no global observer, tracer, meter, or
exporter.

Typed event compilation uses the same program and provider graph. An
`@event.Topic` on a named payload type contributes a synthetic
`event.Publisher[T]` provider;
its exact parameters become graph dependencies on provider-owned
`@event.Listener` receivers. The event IR retains the marker, payload, module,
listener method, order, and exact provider identities. Marker and listener
bodies are never invoked during analysis or generation. The renderer emits
direct `event.NewTopic` construction, binds exact listener method values in
deterministic order, injects caller-owned observers, and assigns the result to
the synthetic exact publisher variable. Invalid observer configuration aborts
construction through the same reverse-cleanup coordinator as provider errors.

Cacheable HTTP reads use the same resolved controller metadata. A qualified
`@cache.Cacheable` occurrence contributes stable cache/route/module identity
and exact key/value types to immutable application IR. The key must be an
exported comparable named request struct. The compiler rejects writes, raw or
no-content routes, transaction boundaries, duplicate cache names, and
authorization-sensitive caching without an explicit principal-bearing key.
The renderer adds deterministic capacity/TTL schema properties, constructs the
bounded typed store after providers, and emits direct get/call/put route logic.
Cache identity and exact key/value metadata participate in the ownership hash;
configuration or observer failures abort through reverse provider cleanup.

## Editor analysis projection

`compiler/service` packages the same load, resolution, validation, module,
application, and pure-generation stages as an instance-owned overlay-aware
analysis API. `spice lsp` projects that result into standard JSON-RPC rather
than parsing comments or rebuilding a second editor model. Resolved definitions
drive annotation/argument completion, bootstrap definitions supply allowed
values, the module graph supplies exact module APIs, generated configuration
metadata supplies property completion/hover, and shared suggested fixes become
version-checked workspace edits.

The projection also exposes the compiler-owned Go-interface catalog and
provider type metadata. This lets every editor offer the same package-qualified
interface candidates and safe namespace imports without reimplementing type
discovery. Interface diagnostics and their actions are anchored at the visible
`@` byte rather than the concealed physical `// ` prefix; insertion edits still
target the actual line start. Partial provider authoring metadata may be
projected for completion and fixes, but an invalid upstream stage never leaks a
partial application model into generation.

For explicit annotation imports, the service also projects the descriptor's
real Go declaration, GoDoc, examples, compatibility, resolved module and
replacement provenance, authorized tool/handler/protocol, and resolved
implementation source symbol. The language server uses that projection for
alias-aware import and annotation completion, rich hover and signature help,
definition navigation, and Go-to-implementation. Neither the LSP nor GoLand
maintains a second annotation registry or a virtual built-in declaration page.

Every open-document set is one compiler overlay request. A monotonic workspace
sequence cancels and rejects stale work; editor publication additionally checks
the current document versions. The service never applies its generation plan,
so analysis cannot write generated source or ownership manifests. See
[`lsp.md`](lsp.md) for the wire contract and editor setup.
