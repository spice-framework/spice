# Spice Framework for Go

Unified documentation: [spiceframework.dev/framework](https://spiceframework.dev/framework/).

> **Ecosystem migration:** Spice is moving to independently versioned core,
> toolchain, editor, starter, and reference-application repositories under
> [`github.com/spice-framework`](https://github.com/spice-framework). The
> history-preserving topology and acceptance ledger are documented in
> [ADR 0012](adrs/0012-multi-repository-product-boundaries.md) and the
> [repository migration ledger](docs/repository-migration.md). Until the first
> authenticated preview is published, the project remains pre-alpha.

Organization governance and cross-repository development tooling now live at
[`spice-framework/.github`](https://github.com/spice-framework/.github) and
[`spice-framework/development`](https://github.com/spice-framework/development).
The core module and complete source history now live at
[`spice-framework/spice`](https://github.com/spice-framework/spice). Historical
repository URLs redirect to the organization. Independent consumer/editor
extraction and the first external-service starter wave are complete. The
remaining migration stages and exact acceptance evidence are tracked in the
repository migration ledger.

Spice is an opinionated, compile-time application platform for Go. Its goal is to bring the breadth, productivity, and operational completeness associated with Spring Boot together with Spring Modulith-style architectural enforcement—without importing JVM runtime magic into Go.

## Product direction

Spice is designed around five commitments:

1. **Broad application-platform coverage.** The roadmap intentionally covers web APIs, configuration, dependency injection, validation, security, data access, transactions, messaging, scheduling, observability, testing, and modular architecture.
2. **Excellent developer ergonomics.** Common application behavior should be easy to express, errors should point to source, generated behavior should be inspectable, and the happy path should be obvious.
3. **Valid Go source.** Spice annotations are ordinary Go comments such as `// @Controller(prefix="/users")`, so standard Go tools continue to parse the project.
4. **Compile-time enforcement.** Wiring, annotation validation, and module rules should fail before deployment whenever possible.
5. **Runnable software, not paper architecture.** Every implementation change must compile, execute its relevant smoke path, and pass tests before it is considered complete.

## Current foundation

The independently versioned Spice ecosystem currently provides:

- A typed Go package-loading pipeline with stable declaration identities.
- Annotation parsing, resolution, and source-positioned validation.
- Exact concrete bean/configuration providers, constructible service/controller/
  repository stereotypes, and explicit `@Implements` interface bindings with
  deterministic qualifiers, primary/fallback selection, ordered collection
  injection, typed optional/lazy/provider handles, and explicit
  singleton/prototype/request/session ownership.
- Typed provider cleanup and `@OnStart`/`@OnStop` lifecycle metadata with a race-safe rollback and shutdown coordinator.
- A preferred annotated package-main `func main()` that discovers the selected
  local module scope at compile time, plus a pre-1.0 compatible exact-type
  parameter-root marker form, both assembled with provider, lifecycle, and
  typed bootstrap-feature data in one immutable application IR.
- Annotation-driven generated commands with conventional environment
  configuration, structured command logging, explicit management/logging
  companions, redacted configuration reporting, stable exit codes, signal
  ownership, and bounded graceful shutdown.
- A pure deterministic renderer for direct provider/lifecycle calls and SHA-256 ownership manifests.
- Guarded generated-file ownership with manual-edit refusal, freshness checks, bounded diffs, and unchanged-file preservation.
- Import-path application modules with root APIs, named interfaces, explicit dependencies, internal-boundary checks, unassigned-package reporting, and deterministic cycle detection.
- Module-aware synchronous lifecycle observations that generated applications expose without a global tracer or telemetry dependency.
- Reflection-free typed configuration declarations, exact provider injection, generated schema/binders, and a runtime with rooted JSON/profile files, explicit precedence, provenance, environment mapping, defaults, validation, and secret redaction.
- Standard-library SQL transaction management with repository-friendly executors, explicit callback-context executor access, module-owned boundary metadata, rollback-safe error/panic behavior, synchronous observations, and generated `@data.Transactional` typed HTTP or interface-bound service boundaries.

  broker acceptance remains application/environment-owned.
- An independently versioned

- Restartable ordered batch jobs with atomic attempt/checkpoint contracts, exact
  completed-prefix validation, fresh failure contexts, panic containment,
  bounded observations, a concurrency-safe capacity-bounded in-process store,

  verified backend in the independent PostgreSQL starter.
- An independently versioned

  selected through `@otel.Enable`, with OpenTelemetry v1.44 HTTP trace/metric
  integration, exact generated observer-role validation, payload-free
  module-event spans and metrics, and application-owned providers/exporters.
- Immutable authenticated principals plus compile-time `@security.Authorize`
  route and service-method policies that generate deny-by-default guards, stable
  module/policy identities, and bounded authorization observations.
- Compile-time interface decorators for service-method `@data.Transactional`,

  responses, cancellation, concurrent rendering, and generated form/view
  adapters with immutable binding results and safe local 303 redirects.
- Immutable transport-neutral mail messages with caller-owned identity and
  time, stable envelope recipients, Bcc-safe deterministic MIME, text/HTML
  alternatives, bounded attachments, defensive copies, and no hidden network
  client.
- An instance-owned `mail/mailtest` sender with bounded immutable attempts,
  deterministic injected failures, explicit overflow, payload-free
  observations, concurrent inspection, and typed MIME snapshots.

- Typed controller/route compilation and deterministic generated `net/http` adapters with exact receiver/mux/renderer providers, request DTO and form binding, closed HTML/redirect outcomes, RFC 9457 errors, ServeMux wildcard checks, and raw escape hatches.
- A runnable `spice` CLI with `version`, `annotations`, `verify`, `modules`,
  `generate`, `build`, `run`, last-known-good `dev`, and editor-neutral `lsp`
  commands.
- An independently versioned [GoLand plugin](https://github.com/spice-framework/goland)
  that renders canonical declaration comments
  as zero-width-prefix annotations, applies configurable native syntax colors,
  resolves highlighted PSI references to their real Go SDK descriptor
  declarations, shows descriptor provenance in the gutter, runs applications
  through `spice run`, generates before native GoLand package debugging,
  checks light/dark rendering against committed visual goldens, and launches
  the same LSP for descriptor documentation, handler implementation
  navigation, completion, diagnostics, safe edits, and cancellable confirmed
  hash-guarded `go get -tool` preview/apply. Interface completion and bean
  selection come from Spice's typed compiler catalog; the plugin uses GoLand's
  index only to navigate and generate methods for symbols already in source.
- A supported secondary Zed extension that launches the same LSP beside
  `gopls` for completion, diagnostics, hover, modifier-click annotation
  navigation, safe quick fixes, module/configuration metadata, and structured
  valid-Go annotation highlighting on Windows and Linux.
- A generated-application HTTP test slice with loopback-only serving, bounded
  detached responses, strict JSON/problem decoding, construction rollback,
  and idempotent lifecycle cleanup, plus transaction-scoped generic SQL
  subjects that always roll back.
- A committed generated HTTP application with real provider, lifecycle, route, and graceful-drain tests.
- An independent, consumer-owned Spring Petclinic port whose `go.mod`
  authorizes the annotation tool and whose generated source, manifest, vendor
  tree, tests, and executable workflow are verified outside the framework
  module at
  [`spice-framework/petclinic`](https://github.com/spice-framework/petclinic).
- A cross-platform Go-owned quality gate with pinned format, lint, nil-safety, security, vulnerability, race, fuzz, coverage, offline-vendor, and executable checks.
- Product, architecture, annotation, and Spring-coverage documents.

## Annotation syntax

Annotations are valid declaration comments with explicit file-scoped imports:

```go
// @import { Controller } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/web"

// @Controller(prefix="/users")
type UserController struct{}
```

Named imports keep common annotations clean, aliases resolve local collisions,
and namespace imports keep provenance visible:

```go
// @import { Get as GET } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/web"
// @import * as security from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/security"

// @GET("/orders/{id}")
// @security.Authorize(anyRoles=["admin"], allScopes=["orders:write"])
func (*Controller) Get(context.Context, Request) (Response, error)
```

The application root `go.mod` authorizes annotation handlers through standard
Go tool dependencies:

```go
tool (
    github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice
    github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice-annotation-core
)
```

Spice statically decodes each one-file Go descriptor and launches only its
authorized full package path through `go tool`; there is no plugin manifest or
custom dependency resolver. Editor installation assistance uses the standard Go
command against a temporary modfile, shows the exact `go.mod`/`go.sum` diff,
and requires a separate confirmed action before applying the still-current
preview.

`spice new` creates a minimal valid-Go application and exact Go module without
downloads or destructive overwrite. `spice add package@version` and
`spice add --tool package@version` expose the same temporary-modfile planner to
developers: preview is the default, and `--apply` writes only a freshly
validated hash-guarded plan. The clean-room smoke gate generates from zero
output, vendors offline, compiles, tests, builds, and executes that scaffold.

The independent modules under
[`testdata/annotationfixture`](testdata/annotationfixture) and
[`testdata/annotationapp`](testdata/annotationapp) prove that a third party can
use only the public SDK/protocol to supply aliases, namespaces, diagnostics,
real editor navigation, provider semantics, and inspectable generated Go.

### Explicit bean selection and scopes

Spice never treats general Go assignability as dependency discovery. A
concrete result becomes an interface candidate only through `@Implements` and
the compiler's exact `go/types` verification, while a factory returning the
exact interface type is already an interface bean. Spice writes the matching
Go compile-time assertion into a manifest-owned source shard beside the
implementation; handwritten source stays focused on behavior.

```go
// @import { Implements, Primary, Qualifier, Service } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/core"
// @import * as payments from "example.com/commerce/payments"

// @Service(name="stripeProcessor", aliases=["payments"])
// @Implements(payments.Processor)
// @Qualifier("stripe")
// @Primary
type StripeProcessor struct{}

func NewCheckout(
	// @Qualifier("stripe")
	processor payments.Processor,
) *Checkout
```

Single values first apply requested qualifiers, ignore fallback beans when a
regular candidate exists, select a unique candidate or primary, and finally
use an exact parameter-name match against bean names and aliases. Ambiguity is
a compile error with candidate locations. `[]T` and `map[string]T` inject all
matching beans in `@Order`, bean-name, and source order.

The generic `bean.Optional[T]`, `bean.Lazy[T]`, and `bean.Provider[T]` contracts
remain ordinary typed Go. `Optional` permits absence but never ambiguity.
`Lazy` resolves a singleton once. `Provider.Acquire(ctx)` returns the exact
value, an idempotent `lifecycle.Cleanup`, and an error. Prototype cleanup is
caller-owned; request and session beans are cached in an explicit typed
`bean.Scope` attached to context. The generated application installs request
scope middleware when required. Session scopes are deliberately created and
closed by application code—there is no global session registry.

## Run it

Install Go 1.26.6 and GNU Make, then run:

New users should begin with the executable
[`getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) walkthrough. Spring developers
can use [`spring-to-spice.md`](docs/spring-to-spice.md) as a concept and
migration map.

```bash
make fast
make check
make verify
make verify-release
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice version
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice verify ./...
git clone https://github.com/spice-framework/commerce.git
cd commerce
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice annotations list ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice annotations doctor ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice verify --format=json ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice test --module github.com/spice-framework/commerce/orders --count=1 ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice generate --check --target Commerce .
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice run --target Commerce . -- -check
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice dev --target Commerce .
```

Use `make fast` for changed packages and their reverse dependency closure, then
`make check` for the broader core-library loop. Run `make verify` on the exact
tree before committing. `make verify-release` is the unconditional full-gate
entrypoint used by the protected keyless source-release workflow; its exact
workflow identity, portable provenance, and approval model are documented in
[`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md). Toolchain binary release automation
and performance budgets run in the standalone toolchain repository.

In an application module containing one typed `@Application` marker:

```bash
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice generate ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice generate --check ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice generate --diff ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice build ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice run ./... -- -check
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice dev ./...
```

Application-platform conventions live on the ordinary process entrypoint and
compile into a directly imported generated target package:

```go
package main

import (
    "os"

    spiceapp "github.com/spice-framework/commerce/internal/spicegen/commerce"
)

// @import { Application } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/core"
// @import { Enable } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/management"
// @import { Logging } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice/annotation/observability"

// @Application
// @Enable(expose=["health", "liveness", "readiness", "info", "metrics", "configprops", "modules"])
// @Logging
func main() {
    os.Exit(spiceapp.Main(os.Args[1:]))
}
```

The generated `Main` returns an exit code and does not call `os.Exit`. It resolves
the generated schema from the `SPICE_` environment convention, logs command
startup and failures, owns `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, and creates a fresh bounded
shutdown context. `spice.shutdown-timeout` defaults to `10s` and can be set
with `SPICE_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`.

Controller targets also own `artifacts/openapi.json` in the internal generated
package; generation check/diff verifies it alongside the orchestrator and
source-owned units.

Production services opt into only the management routes they intend to expose
with `@management.Enable(expose=[...])`. The endpoint allowlist is exact and
validated at compile time; package presence or a `go.mod` dependency never
activates it. See
[`docs/management.md`](docs/management.md).

For a repository containing package-level `@Module` roots:

```bash
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice modules --format=json ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice modules --format=mermaid ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice modules --format=plantuml ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice modules --focus=example.com/shop/orders --format=json ./...
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice test --module=example.com/shop/orders --race --count=1 ./...
```

JSON contains complete portable module canvases. Mermaid and PlantUML aggregate
the same verified package-import edges into deterministic module diagrams.
`--focus` retains one module and only its transitively observed dependencies,
with dependency-first composition order for module test slices.
`spice test` validates that same graph and invokes ordinary `go test -trimpath`
for exactly its owned packages, excluding unrelated and unassigned packages.
See [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

Use `--target Name`, the command import path, or the stable marker symbol ID
when the selected packages contain multiple application markers. Positional Go
package patterns provide explicit compile-time scope in a multi-application
monorepo; an ordinary single-application module needs no dummy imports or
module list. Package-main generation writes an importable
`internal/spicegen/<target>` package split into contracts, configuration,
providers, bounded assembly, optional features, HTTP coordination, readable
stable per-route files, lifecycle, and command behavior. It mirrors each
contributing handwritten file to one nested
`sources/.../<source>_spice_gen.go` unit. No generated Go is written beside
handwritten code, and there is no catch-all target file. Every concern role,
source origin, and generated range is recorded in the schema-5
`.spice/<target>.manifest.json`; `spice generated` queries that mapping in
either direction.

To start the example HTTP server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spice-framework/commerce.git
cd commerce
go tool github.com/spice-framework/toolchain/cmd/spice run --target Commerce .
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"quantity\":2}" http://localhost:8081/orders
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/health/readiness
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/configprops
curl http://localhost:8081/actuator/modules
```

The independently versioned
[`spice-framework/commerce`](https://github.com/spice-framework/commerce)
application enables structured request/lifecycle logging
and exactly seven management endpoints. Its generated command owns
`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`, conventional environment loading, check mode, stable exit
codes, and fresh bounded shutdown. Its generated application also owns the
fixed-delay audit and exposes a typed, bounded asynchronous inventory
verification method that drains before provider cleanup. The generated
`Application` itself never captures process signals. Generated source and
OpenAPI are committed under `internal/spicegen/commerce` in that repository;
source-owned
application metadata, configuration binders, constructors, and interface
checks use mirrored files below
`internal/spicegen/commerce/sources`. The matching ownership manifest is
`.spice/commerce.manifest.json`. Commerce is a separate consuming Go module
with its own verification policy, module graph, and vendor tree.

For embedding and specialized policies, the generated application retains
`NewApplication`, `NewApplicationWithOptions`, `Application.Start`,
`Application.Stop`, `Application.Run`, `Application.Components`, and
`RunCommand`. `Components` is a typed singleton snapshot for tests and
embedding—not a runtime lookup container. These seams support caller-owned
contexts, signals, configuration sources, middleware, error mapping,
lifecycle/HTTP observers, writers, loggers, and shutdown timing.

## Status

Spice is pre-1.0. Its developer-proof core, generated application lifecycle,
Modulith enforcement, web/configuration/security/data foundations, and
Petclinic reference workflow are executable and locally gated. The primary
GoLand integration is independently versioned and gated on Windows, Linux, and
macOS from
[`spice-framework/goland`](https://github.com/spice-framework/goland). Public
contracts may still evolve until every coverage row is resolved and the v1.0
compatibility policy is frozen.
